# Wave (Work in progress)

## Description

Wave is a Web3 application that allows messages to be sent and received through smart contracts on the etherium network. Currently this application is using the Rinkeby Testnet to avoid paying real ether gas fees.

Currently, this repo contains no front-end code as I am using Replit to store the front-end code and to deploy it. I will add my front-end code at a later time.

This app was built for educational purposes.

## Dependencies

- Hardhat
- React
- Ethers
- Vite

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Create a .env file using .envEXAMPLE as a template. You can get your alchemy key by logging in and creating an application [here](https://www.alchemy.com/).
